# Fruit-Slicing-game
A fruit slicing game made using HTML, CSS and JQuery. Basically, when we click on the start button, we will start getting random fruits from the sky and we are supposed to slice them. If we slice the fruit, our score goes up by 1 point and if we miss the fruit we loose the one trail and once we loose all the three initial trials then the game will be over and our final score will be shown to us.
